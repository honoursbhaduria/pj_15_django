 Nested Serializers


In web development, creating and consuming APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) is commonplace. Django Rest Framework (DRF) serves as a robust toolkit for building APIs in Django-based web applications. Within DRF, a pivotal concept is serializers. In this article, we will delve into the concept of nested serializers in Django and how they facilitate the handling of complex data relationships.

## Significance of Nested Serializers
In many real-world scenarios, data models exhibit relationships with one another. For instance, you may have a Book model associated with a Category model through a foreign key. In such cases, merely serializing the Book object may not be sufficient; you might want to include the related Category information within the serialized output. This is precisely where nested serializers come into play.
